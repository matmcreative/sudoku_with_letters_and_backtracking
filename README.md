# Objective1 | Standard Sudoku (numbers, 9x9)
Create a Python script to solve standard 9x9 Sudoku puzzles.  Use the backtracking algorithm to find a solution to any solvable sudoku board.

# Process1 | Standard Sudoku (numbers, 9x9)
* Create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset

  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

* Print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

# Objective2 | Letter Sudoku (letters, 9x9)
Create a Python script to solve 9x9 Sudoku puzzles using letters instead of numbers.  Use the backtracking algorithm to find a solution to any solvable sudoku board.

# Process2 | Letter Sudoku (letters, 9x9)
* Create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

  * The total number of votes cast

  * A complete list of candidates who received votes

  * The percentage of votes each candidate won

  * The total number of votes each candidate won

  * The winner of the election based on popular vote.

* In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

# Objective3 | Giant Sudoku (numbers, 25x25)
Create a Python script to solve standard 9x9 Sudoku puzzles.  Use the backtracking algorithm to find a solution to any solvable sudoku board.

# Process3 | Giant Sudoku (numbers, 25x25)
* Create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset

  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

* Print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

# Objective4 | Giant Letter Sudoku (letters, 25x25)
Create a Python script to solve 9x9 Sudoku puzzles using letters instead of numbers.  Use the backtracking algorithm to find a solution to any solvable sudoku board.

# Process4 | Giant Letter Sudoku (letters, 25x25)
* Create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

  * The total number of votes cast

  * A complete list of candidates who received votes

  * The percentage of votes each candidate won

  * The total number of votes each candidate won

  * The winner of the election based on popular vote.

* In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

# Troubleshooting
* In Giant Sudoku, challenge is to add leading 0's to single digit numbers in order for visual grid to line up prpoerly.
